                <p>The first generation Skyline (KPGC10, also refered to as just the C10) debuted in 1969 after the companies Nissan and Prince Merged. The Skyline came into to prodcution,<br>
                succeding the Prince Sedan. The sucess came within the Skyline's GTR model which came with sporty design, such as wings, and delivered with better driverain and motor upgrades<br>
                The Skyline GTR came in a longeivtal inline-six, Rear Wheel Drive layout until the arrival of the R32. The R32 came upgraded with the rally favored All wheel Drive format and<br>
                upgraded 2.6L RB26DETT (twin-turbo) inline-six. The R33 came with All Wheel Drive specs and the 2.6 L RB26DETT twin-turbo but also came with 2.8 L RB-X GT2 twin-turbo<br>
                inline-six option. The R34 came with the 2.6L inline-six or could be uprgarded to a 2.8L from Z-Tune. It also upgraeded from the 5 speed manual layout to a 6 speed. The R34 was<br>
                discontinued in 2002. The Skyline GTR was a foundational car in the JDM era and was feautured in <i>The Fast and The Furious</i> as a 1995 R33 and also became one of Paul Walker's<br>
                signature cars as it's apperance in <i>2 Fast 2 Furious</i> as a 1999 R34. Many Skylines had to be imported from Japan and be tamed by American laws. It had to be properly inspected<br>
                and fit to the regulations. After the annoucned success of the legendary car, Nissan launched the GTR, which dropped the Skyline name, in 2007. This model came with a 3.8L VR38DETT V6 <br>
                and showcased a dual clutch transmission. This transmission runs as a semi-automatic, meaning it can be shifted through paddle shifters mounted on the wheel.<br>
